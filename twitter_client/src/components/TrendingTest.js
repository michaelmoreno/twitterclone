          here is some filler text that is hopefully long enough to simulate an
          article. I also hope it wraps well and that I've been able to figure
          out how to get this right bar to take up 30% of the screen.
          additionally the navbar on the right should also take up 30%. A keen
          eye might have noticed that this would leave the remaining 40% for the
          feed. Who know's if I've figured that all out yet though. An actually
          twitter article might hav been shorter than this nonesense
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
